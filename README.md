# 09-README-Generator

## Description

For this assignment the goal was to take the provided starter code and use the inquirer package to create a command line application that generates a professional README.md file. The application will be invoked by using the following command: node index.js. The user will then be prompted for information about their application repository. The README will be populated with the user's responses to the prompts. The README will also include a table of contents, links to sections of the README, and a license badge based on the user's selection.
